# The Dog Farm

A React.js Project

## Summery

The motivation for this app was a business idea that sells dogs of different breeds.
This business would need to have an app for users interested in becoming a new pet owner and give the business the ability to add new breeds of dog they may have to list.
Attributes detailing the unique features and physical traits of the specific breed like grooming needs, weight, and height.
This app will help the user make a better-informed decision before getting a dog that may not fit their lifestyle or personality.
The app currently consists of 3 pages. Home, Doglist, and Dogform. The app would expand much like the business, offering optional training of the dog with the owner by adding a scheduling
system. Add a page for people to create a profile for people and be able to have a favorite dog list of breeds the user likes. More info on the dog cards like overall health issues.  

### Pages

1. Home:

The Home page is the intro to the app. It consists of the project title and a quick description of what is about.

2. Doglist(Dogs):

The "Dog list" page is where all the info for the different dog breeds is. This page is mostly the user side of the app. 
The idea for the look of each breeds personal info(section)was to look kinda like a trading card.
The cards have the breed's name, a picture of that breed, attributes specific to the dog, and a 
brief description of the breed's personality.

3. DogForm(Add Dog):

The "Dog form" is mostly for the business side. Giving the business the ability to add to the dog list for new breeds they may offer.
The form has inputs for the name, image, attributes(weight, height, color, lifespan, energy, and grooming).
Allowing the business to inform their future customers on what to look forward to when getting a certain breed.
For example, a customer would know that if the dog has a high grooming need, the dog will shed fur or more likely need more
trips for a trim.

### Conclusion

This app in a business mindset is not to give the user too much info but enough to steer them towards contacting
the business for more info through a professional.
